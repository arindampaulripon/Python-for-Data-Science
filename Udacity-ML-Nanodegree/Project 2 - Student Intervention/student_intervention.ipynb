So regardless of the dimension of our data, the key question is: how do we know which one is the \"best\" one given unseen data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM approach to deciding the best separating hyperplane given any data is to generate what is called a maximum margin decision boundary. Support Vector Machine classifiers provide a decision boundary that seeks to divide the classes at the point of maximum distance from data points of each category. This can be understood by observing the next figure:\n",

    "Margins are defined as the smallest perpendicular distance between the decision boundary and any of the data points as illustrated in Figure 2. Here we see two possible separating hyperplanes, with (a) having smaller margins than (b). The general rule that SVM follows is that a hyperplane with larger margins, such as the one in (b), provides for greater generalisation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively the idea is that as more data points are added, the hyperpane with the larger margin will be more accurate at classifying future data than the hyperpane with the smaller margin. That is, it is more likely that the hyperplane in (b) will separate unseen data with higher accuracy than the hyperplane in (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know why the maximum margin hyperplane is the \"best\" line for the classification task shown in Figure 1 and 2, there is another intuitive observation to be made. This is that as the SVM looks to draw the decision boundary with the largest margin, it depends on fewer points for choosing a gradient for that line. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that the SVM gives most importance to data closest to the decision boundary. The data it uses to actually \"draw\" the line are called support vectors."
